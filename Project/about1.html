    <h1 align="center"> About the game </h1>
    <p>This game was made as a part of my CS25210 assignment. The game was created using CSS, HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The game is a spaceship that avoids the meteors and uses laser cannons to destroy them. All images for the game are created using the canvas. The game features levels that get progressingly harder</p>
    <h1 align="center"> How to play </h1>
    <p>The objective of the game is to monouver the spaceship around the meteors while firing at them and destroying them with the lasers. The spaceship is controlled using the W, A, S and D keys on the keyboard and the lasers are aimed using the cursor and fired using the left click. The aim of the game is to complete all four levels which get progressingly more difficult.</p>
    <h1 align="center"> Resources Used </h1>
    <p>The resources I used for this module were code that I had previously written for the Cs25010 assignment, from which I used aspects of the HTML and CSS. I also used <a href="w3cschools.com">w3cSchools</a> in order to better my knowledge of JavaScript, I also found some useful help in the slides for the lectures for this module such as with using the canvas. All code re-use will be in better detail in the report for this game.</p> 
    <h1 align="center"> Sounds </h1>
    <p>The sounds I used for the game can be found <a href="http://gamethemesongs.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bigsoundbank.com/">here</a>, the sounds obtained are all licensed correctly and are free, royalty free sounds. </p>
    <h1 align="center"> Images </h1>
    <p> The images used for the game were all created using the canvas so require no licensing.</p>
    <h1 align="center"> Improvements </h1>
    <p>If I had more time to perfect this game, I would be able to add in a scoring system which I failed to achieve and I would also create something for the end game rather than the game just returning to it's beginning state. I would also add the ability to be able to mute the background music, as I could not add it to to a lack of time. I would also fix some minor errors such as the laser sound being played after the game is paused and also that the cursor cannot be moved while the lasers are being fired. I would also create some sprites for the spaceship and for the meteor given more time.</p>
    <h1 align="center"> Declaration of Originality</h1>
    <p>I declare that the contents of this game are entirely my own work, with the exceptions outlined throughout. Resources I used include the example game given to us by Edel, Lecture Slides, W3Schools, StackOverflow, Seth Ladd's blog and my own code. I also searched the internet for solutions to many problems and error messages etc. The Images were made by myself(on canvas), and sounds are royalty free/free to use.
